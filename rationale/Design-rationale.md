Design Rationale – FUTURE_UX_02  
Appointment-Based Gym Mobile Application

Target Users

The primary users of this application are gym members who prefer booking workout sessions in advance instead of walk-in systems.  
The app is designed for users who want clarity about their sessions, timings, and preparation before visiting the gym.

Booking Flow Logic:

The booking flow follows a simple three-step structure:

1. Appointment Creation  
   Users select workout type, date, time, branch, and optional preferences such as coach and medical conditions.

2. Appointment Review  
   All selected details are shown again before final submission to avoid mistakes.

3. Confirmation Screen  
   A clear confirmation message is displayed once the appointment is successfully scheduled.

This flow ensures transparency and reduces booking errors.



UX Decisions:

- A dark theme was chosen to match the gym and fitness environment.  
- The app follows an appointment-based system to reduce crowding and confusion.  
- Minimal input fields are used to reduce cognitive load.  
- Optional fields such as preferred coach and medical conditions provide flexibility without forcing input.  
- A checklist concept is included to help users prepare before their scheduled session.



How This Design Improves User Experience:

- Clear navigation from login to booking confirmation.  
- Reduced uncertainty through a dedicated review screen.  
- Faster booking with minimal steps.  
- Better preparedness through the checklist concept.  

Overall, the design focuses on clarity, simplicity, and realistic usage for gym members.
