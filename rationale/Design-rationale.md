# INTRODUCTION

The Task-2 (Appointment-Based Gym Mobile Application) focuses on designing a complete mobile app UI for a gym that works on an appointment-based system.

For this task, I designed a mobile application for “The Platinum Gym”, where users can book workout sessions in advance instead of using a walk-in system.
The main aim of this project was to design a clear, simple, and realistic booking experience for gym users.

# TARGET USERS

The target users for this application are gym members who prefer structured workout sessions with fixed timings.
These users expect clarity about their appointments, session details, and confirmation before visiting the gym.

The app is designed for users who want a smooth and predictable gym experience without confusion or overcrowding.

# LAYOUT STRUCTURE

The layout structure of the mobile application is designed to keep the user flow simple and easy to understand.

The Opening / Login Screens allow users to log in or sign up quickly using mobile number or email.

The Home Screen acts as the main dashboard where users can view quick health details, upcoming sessions, today’s session, and quick booking options.

The Appointment Booking Screen is designed as the core feature of the app, where users can enter workout details, date, time, branch, and preferences.

The Review Appointment Screen allows users to recheck all selected details before confirming the booking.

The Confirmation Screen clearly informs the user that the appointment has been successfully scheduled.

The Account Page displays user details and provides access to personal information, appointments, and health-related actions.

# BOOKING FLOW

The booking flow is designed as a step-by-step process to avoid errors and confusion:

Users enter appointment details such as workout type, date, time, and duration.

Users review all the entered details before final submission.

A confirmation message is shown after the appointment is successfully scheduled.

This flow helps users feel confident before confirming their session.

# UX DECISIONS

The UX decisions were made to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience for gym users.
A dark theme was used to match the gym and fitness environment.
The appointment-based system was chosen to reduce crowding and provide better session management.
Minimal input fields were used to reduce cognitive load.
Optional fields such as preferred coach and medical conditions provide flexibility without forcing extra input.
A checklist concept was added to help users prepare before their gym session.

# DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

The design focuses on clarity and ease of use.
By keeping the booking flow simple and structured, users can quickly complete their appointment without confusion.
The review screen helps reduce booking mistakes.
Clear confirmation improves user trust in the system.
The account page helps users manage their personal information easily.

# CONCLUSION

This project helped me understand how mobile UI and UX decisions affect user behavior in real-world applications.
Overall, the design improves usability by making the entire process predictable and stress-free.
By designing an appointment-based gym mobile app, I focused on creating clear flows, simple layouts, and a user-friendly booking experience.
The task improved my understanding of mobile layout structuring, user flow design, and usability-focused thinking.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and helped me gain confidence in designing complete, realistic mobile application interfaces.
